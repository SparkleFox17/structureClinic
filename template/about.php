        Structure Clinic was founded by Christie Tait, MN NP-PHC. Christie has spent her career working as a Nurse Practitioner in pediatric emergency medicine and neurology. Her extensive experience treating chronic migraines with Botox Â® led her to the field of aesthetic medicine. Now she brings her high level of education and therapeutic treatment skills to clients interested in benefiting from cosmetic applications of these injectable medications.

        At Structure Clinic we specialize in medical injections for both aesthetic and therapeutic outcomes. Treatments are individually customized; which means that we start by learning about you and your goals. Our extensive understanding of anatomy and physiology allows us to provide individualized treatments that are specific to each client. We pride ourselves on high quality, natural looking outcomes.
