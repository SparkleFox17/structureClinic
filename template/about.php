            Structure Clinic was founded by Christie Tait, MN NP-PHC. Christie has spent her career working as a
            nurse practitioner in emergency medicine and neurology. Her extensive experience treating chronic
            migraines with Botoxâ„¢ led her to the field of aesthetic medicine. Now she brings her high level of
            education and therapeutic treatment skills to clients interested in benefitting from cosmetic applications
            of these injectable medications.

            At Structure Clinic we specialize in medical injections for both aesthetic and therapeutic outcomes.
            Treatments are individually customized. That means that we start by learning about you and your goals
            and then we use our professional knowledge to develop a treatment plan to get you there. Our
            extensive understanding of anatomy and physiology allows us to provide individualized treatments that
            are specific to each client. We pride ourselves on high quality, natural outcomes.
            Consultations are complimentary so please contact us if you have any questions or are curious about
            how you can benefit from medical aesthetics.
