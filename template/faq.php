                                This is probably the most common question we encounter and is unique to everyone. The answer will
                                depend on a few factors including: a healthcare provider’s assessment of your features, muscle strength,
                                skin type, and most importantly - your personal goals.<br/>
                                That being said, here are some general estimates that may help you better understand what to expect
                                from your treatment:<br/>
                                Forehead/frown lines – 25 to 50 units<br/>
                                Crow’s feet – 12 to 20 units
                                <br/><br/>
                                Lip flip – 4 to 8 units
                                <br/>

                            How long until I see effects?

                                You may start to see a reduction in muscle movement and wrinkles within 3 days, but full effect is
                                generally seen by 2 weeks after treatment.

                                Wrinkle reduction lasts approximately 3 months but may last longer with regular maintenance.

                            Can I go back to my activities afterwards?

                                Yes! You can apply makeup if you’d like go back to you day without anyone knowing about your
                                treatment. We recommend avoiding strenuous activity for a day and avoid lying down for 4 hours after
                                treatment. You should also avoid any hats or headbands resting on the treated area.
