                                Botox&reg; and Dysport &reg; are both brand names of medications known as neuromodulators. Neuromodulators work by temporarily blocking the signal from the nerve that tells the muscle to contract. When small amounts of these medications are injected, they relax the movement of targeted facial muscles. When you decrease the movement of these muscles you also decrease wrinkling and smooth out the appearance of the skin.

                                The effects of these medications wear off after approximately 3 months. However, with regular treatments results may last longer and a smaller dose may be required. Botox&reg; and Dysport can help to prevent the appearance of permanent wrinkles and soften existing fine lines.

                                The cost of treatment depends on the number of neuromodulator units required. During your consultation we will discuss your goals and how these products can help achieve those outcomes.  A treatment plan will be developed based on an assessment of your facial anatomy, your goals, and your budget. Cost is always determined prior to treatment. 
                                Neuromodulators start at $9 per unit.

                                This is probably the most common question we encounter and is unique to everyone.  The answer will depend on a few factors including: a healthcare provider’s assessment of your features, muscle strength, skin type, and most importantly - your personal goals.

                                That being said, here are some general estimates that may help you better understand what to expect from your treatment:

                                You may start to see a reduction in muscle movement and wrinkles within 3 days, but the full effect is generally seen by 2 weeks after treatment.  We like to see you for a follow up appointment 2 weeks after your treatment to assess for effect and to ensure your are satisfied with the results. It is not uncommon to need a small touch up at the follow up appointment.

                                This has become a popular term to simply describe a small number of units.  If you want a look with a very subtle reduction in muscle movement then we can do this for you.  The facial anatomy assessment and product used for treatment is the same regardless of the terms used.

                                Allow 30-45 minutes for your first appointment.  This allows for a full assessment, health history, treatment plan, and the treatment itself.  Subsequent visits are typically 15-30 minutes.

Your first treatments are about perfecting the dose and placement of product in your muscles.  It’s not uncommon to require a small touch up at the time of follow up.

                                If you have never had a Botox® or Dysport® treatment, then ideally you should have your first treatment 4 months before your important event so that the dose and effect can be fine tuned before the big day.  Otherwise, 3 to 4 weeks before the event would be the best timing.
