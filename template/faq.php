                                Botox&reg; and Dysport &reg; are both brand names of medications known as neuromodulators. Neuromodulators work by temporarily blocking the signal from the nerve that tells the muscle to contract. When small amounts of these medications are injected, they relax the movement of targeted facial muscles. When you decrease the movement of these muscles you also decrease wrinkling and smooth out the appearance of the skin.

                                The effects of these medications wear off after approximately 3 months. However, with regular treatments results may last longer and a smaller dose may be required. Botox&reg; and Dysport can help to prevent the appearance of permanent wrinkles and soften existing fine lines.

                                The cost of treatment depends on the number of neuromodulator units required. During your consultation we will discuss your goals and how these products can help achieve those outcomes.  A treatment plan will be developed based on an assessment of your facial anatomy, your goals, and your budget. Cost is always determined prior to treatment. 
                                Neuromodulators start at $9 per unit.

                                This is probably the most common question we encounter and is unique to everyone.  The answer will depend on a few factors including: a healthcare provider’s assessment of your features, muscle strength, skin type, and most importantly - your personal goals.

                                You may start to see a reduction in muscle movement and wrinkles within 3 days, but the full effect is generally seen by 2 weeks after treatment.  We like to see you for a follow up appointment 2 weeks after your treatment to assess for effect and to ensure your are satisfied with the results. It is not uncommon to need a small touch up at the follow up appointment.

                                This has become a popular term to simply describe a small number of units.  If you want a look with a very subtle reduction in muscle movement then we can do this for you.  The facial anatomy assessment and product used for treatment is the same regardless of the terms used.

                                If you have never had a Botox® or Dysport® treatment, then ideally you should have your first treatment 4 months before your important event so that the dose and effect can be fine tuned before the big day.  Otherwise, 3 to 4 weeks before the event would be the best timing.

                                Botulinum Toxin: Aftercare Instructions
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Exercise your treated muscles for the first hour after treatment (e.g. practice frowning, raising your eyebrows or squinting). This helps to work the treatment into your muscles. Although this may help your procedure outcome, it will not impact your treatment negatively if you forget to do this.</li>
                                    <li>Do NOT have a facial, nor rub or massage the treated area for 24 hours after your treatment.</li>
                                    <li>Do NOT lie down or do strenuous exercise for four hours after treatment. Also, avoid any exposure to a sauna, hot tub or tanning for four hours. This will prevent your blood pressure from rising and thus minimize the risk of bruising after treatment.</li>
                                    <li>Some patients experience a mild headache following their treatment. You may take Tylenol for pain relief.</li>
                                    <li>Be assured that tiny bumps or marks will go away within a few hours after your treatment. There is a small risk of bruising. If this occurs, it is temporary and can easily be covered up with makeup. Infrequently small bruising may last up to one week.</li>
                                    <li>After the botulinum toxin is placed into the targeted muscles, the effect begins gradually anywhere from 3-7 days and is not complete for two weeks. A follow up appointment is planned for 2 weeks after your treatment to assess the outcomes.</li>
                                    <li>Treatment will last approximately 3 months. However, if you maintain your treatment appointments with the frequency recommended, the duration of each treatment may last longer than four months.</li>
                                </ul>

                                Botulinum toxin has a long history of use for various medical conditions since the 1970s.  In 2002 it gained approval by the FDA for cosmetic applications.  Injections with botulinum toxin are generally well tolerated and side effects are few. Most commonly there can be mild injection pain, bruising, and/or slight swelling, and a mild headache following the treatment.  
                                If the botulinum toxin moves into an unintended nearby muscle it can cause temporary unwanted weakness of that muscle. It usually resolves in weeks to months depending on the site. According to North American reporting, approximately 1-3% of patients may experience a temporary upper eyelid or brow drooping. The risk of this effect is minimized by remaining in an upright position for three to four hours following injection and avoiding manipulation of the area. Active contraction of the muscles under treatment may increase the uptake of toxin and decrease its diffusion to unintended muscles.
                                Although serious side effects such as allergic reactions are rare, they can occur with any medication.   Full details regarding risk and benefits will be discussed during your consultation and your healthcare provider will answer any questions you may have.
