                        <p>
                            Botox&reg; and Dysport&reg; are examples of medications known as neuromodulators. When very small
                            amounts of these medications are injected into the muscles of the face they relax wrinkles and smooth
                            out the appearance of the skin. These neuromodulators temporarily block the signal from the nerve
                            <br/><br/>
                            that usually tells the muscle to contract. These muscle movements are the cause of wrinkling. The
                            effects of these medications wear off after approximately 3 months. However, with regular treatments
                            results may last longer and a smaller dose may be required.
                            <br/>
                            The most common areas treated with neuromodulators are the forehead, frown lines, and crowâ€™s feet.
                            During your consultation with a Structure Clinic healthcare provider you can discuss any other ways that
                            you might benefit from Botox or Dysport.

                        <p>
                            There are various injectable treatments that can enhance lip appearance and fullness. For a subtle
                            enhancement Botox can be used for a "lip flip." This maintains the natural shape of the lip but relaxes
                            the muscle that causes you to purse your lips into a thin line. It can also help reduce the appearance of
                            those vertical lipstick lines (sometimes called smoker's lines).

                            Jaw clenching and teeth grinding (bruxism) can often lead to pain and headaches. Botox&reg; treatments
                            can be helpful in reducing clenching and grinding. Book a complimentary assessment to find out if this
                            treatment would be helpful for you. Often times the medication can be covered through private
                            insurance and only an injection fee is required.

                        <h3>Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some people experience excessive sweating which can be limiting both socially and professionally.
                            Botox&reg; has been well established in safely treating this condition by interrupting the signal that the
                            nerve sends to sweat glands. Results are typically seen within 1 week and last for 6-12 months. You
                            may be eligible for private insurance coverage for the medication.
